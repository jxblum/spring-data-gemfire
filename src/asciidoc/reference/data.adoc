= Working with the GemFire APIs

Once the GemFire Cache and Regions have been configured they can be injected and used inside application objects. This chapter describes the integration with Spring's Transaction Management functionality and `DaoException` hierarchy. It also covers support for dependency injection of GemFire managed objects.

[[apis:exception-translation]]
== Exception Translation

Using a new data access technology requires not only accommodating a new API but also handling exceptions specific to that technology. To accommodate this case, Spring Framework provides a technology agnostic, consistent http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#dao-exceptions[exception hierarchy] that abstracts the application from proprietary (and usually checked) exceptions to a set of focused runtime exceptions. As mentioned in the Spring Framework documentation, http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#orm-exception-translation[exception translation] can be applied transparently to your data access objects through the use of the `@Repository` annotation and AOP by defining a `PersistenceExceptionTranslationPostProcessor` bean. The same exception translation functionality is enabled when using GemFire as long as at least a `CacheFactoryBean` is declared, e.g. using a `<gfe:cache/>` declaration, as it acts as an exception translator which is automatically detected by the Spring infrastructure and used accordingly.

[[apis:template]]
== GemfireTemplate

As with many other high-level abstractions provided by the Spring projects, Spring Data GemFire provides a *template* that simplifies GemFire data access. The class provides several *one-line* methods, for common region operations but also the ability to *execute* code against the native GemFire API without having to deal with GemFire checked exceptions for example through the `GemfireCallback`.

The template class requires a GemFire `Region` instance and once configured is thread-safe and should be reused across multiple classes:

[source,xml]
----
<bean id="gemfireTemplate" class="org.springframework.data.gemfire.GemfireTemplate" p:region-ref="someRegion"/>
----

Once the template is configured, one can use it alongside `GemfireCallback` to work directly with the GemFire `Region`, without having to deal with checked exceptions, threading or resource management concerns:

[source,java]
----
template.execute(new GemfireCallback<Iterable<String>>() {
	public Iterable<String> doInGemfire(Region reg) throws GemFireCheckedException, GemFireException {
	  	// working against a Region of String
		Region<String, String> region = reg;

		region.put("1", "one");
		region.put("3", "three");

		return region.query("length < 5");
	}
});
----

For accessing the full power of the GemFire query language, one can use the `find` and `findUnique` which, as opposed to the `query` method, can execute queries across multiple regions, execute projections, and the like. The `find` method should be used when the query selects multiple items (through`SelectResults`) and the latter, `findUnique`, as the name suggests, when only one object is returned.

[[apis:spring-cache-abstraction]]
== Support for Spring Cache Abstraction

Since 1.1, Spring Data GemFire provides an implementation of the Spring 3.1 http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#cache[cache abstraction]. To use GemFire as a backing implementation, simply add `GemfireCacheManager` to your configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
  xmlns:cache="http://www.springframework.org/schema/cache"
  xmlns:gfe="http://www.springframework.org/schema/gemfire"
  xmlns:p="http://www.springframework.org/schema/p"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
  	                  http://www.springframework.org/schema/gemfire http://www.springframework.org/schema/gemfire/spring-gemfire.xsd
                      http://www.springframework.org/schema/cache http://www.springframework.org/schema/cache/spring-cache.xsd">

  <!-- turn on declarative caching -->
  <cache:annotation-driven/>

  <gfe:cache id="gemfire-cache"/>

  <!-- declare GemFire Cache Manager -->
  <bean id="cacheManager" class="org.springframework.data.gemfire.support.GemfireCacheManager" p:cache-ref="gemfire-cache">
</beans>
----

[[apis:tx-mgmt]]
== Transaction Management

One of the most popular features of Spring Framework is http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#transaction[transaction management]. If you are not familiar with it, we strongly recommend http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#transaction-motivation[reading] about it as it offers a consistent programming model that works transparently across multiple APIs and can be configured either programmatically or declaratively (the most popular choice).

For GemFire, Spring Data GemFire provides a dedicated, per-cache, transaction manager that, once declared, allows Region operations to be executed atomically through Spring:

[source,xml]
----
<gfe:transaction-manager id="tx-manager" cache-ref="cache"/>
----

NOTE: The example above can be simplified even more by eliminating the `cache-ref` attribute if the GemFire Cache is defined under the default name`gemfireCache`. As with the other Spring Data GemFire namespace elements, if the Cache bean name is not configured, the aforementioned naming convention will used. Additionally, the transaction manager name is`gemfireTransactionManager` if not explicitly specified.

Currently, GemFire supports optimistic transactions with *read committed* isolation. Furthermore, to guarantee this isolation, developers should avoid making *in-place* changes that manually modify values present in the Cache. To prevent this from happening, the transaction manager configures the Cache to use *copy on read* semantics, meaning a clone of the actual value is created, each time a read is performed. This behavior can be disabled if needed through the `copyOnRead` property. For more information on the semantics of the underlying GemFire transaction manager, see the GemFire https://www.vmware.com/support/developer/vfabric-gemfire/700-api/com/gemstone/gemfire/cache/CacheTransactionManager.html[documentation].

[[apis:declarable]]
== Wiring `Declarable` components

GemFire XML configuration (usually named `cache.xml` allows *user* objects to be declared as part of the configuration. Usually these objects are `CacheLoader`s or other pluggable callback components supported by GemFire. Using native GemFire configuration, each user type declared through XML must implement the `Declarable` interface which allows arbitrary parameters to be passed to the declared class through a `Properties` instance.

In this section we describe how you can configure these pluggable components defined in `cache.xml` using Spring while keeping your Cache/Region configuration defined in `cache.xml` This allows your pluggable components to focus on the application logic and not the location or creation of DataSources or other collaboration objects.

However, if you are starting a green field project, it is recommended that you configure Cache, Region, and other pluggable components directly in Spring. This avoids inheriting from the `Declarable` interface or the base class presented in this section. See the following sidebar for more information on this approach.

.Eliminate `Declarable` components
****
One can configure custom types entirely through Spring as mentioned in <<bootstrap:region>>. That way, one does not have to implement the `Declarable` interface and also benefits from all the features of the Spring IoC container (not just dependency injection but also life-cycle and instance management).
****

As an example of configuring a `Declarable` component using Spring, consider the following declaration (taken from the `Declarable` javadoc):

[source,xml]
----
<cache-loader>
   <class-name>com.company.app.DBLoader</class-name>
   <parameter name="URL">
     <string>jdbc://12.34.56.78/mydb</string>
   </parameter>
</cache-loader>
----

To simplify the task of parsing, converting the parameters and initializing the object, Spring Data GemFire offers a base class (`WiringDeclarableSupport`) that allows GemFire user objects to be wired through a *template* bean definition or, in case that is missing, perform autowiring through the Spring container. To take advantage of this feature, the user objects need to extend `WiringDeclarableSupport` which automatically locates the declaring `BeanFactory` and performs wiring as part of the initialization process.

.Why is a base class needed?
****
In the current GemFire release there is no concept of an *object factory* and the types declared are instantiated and used as is. In other words, there is no easy way to manage object creation outside GemFire.
****

[[apis:declarable:template-wiring]]
=== Configuration using *template* definitions

When used, `WiringDeclarableSupport` tries to first locate an existing bean definition and use that as wiring template. Unless specified, the component class name will be used as an implicit bean definition name. Let's see how our `DBLoader` declaration would look in that case:

[source,java]
----
public class DBLoader extends WiringDeclarableSupport implements CacheLoader {
  private DataSource dataSource;

  public void setDataSource(DataSource ds){
    this.dataSource = ds;
  }

  public Object load(LoaderHelper helper) { ... }
}
----

[source,xml]
----
<cache-loader>
   <class-name>com.company.app.DBLoader</class-name>
   <!-- no parameter is passed (use the bean implicit name
   that is the class name) -->
</cache-loader>
----

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xmlns:p="http://www.springframework.org/schema/p"
       xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
           http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

  <bean id="dataSource" ... />

     <!-- template bean definition -->
     <bean id="com.company.app.DBLoader" abstract="true" p:dataSource-ref="dataSource"/>
</beans>
----

In the scenario above, as no parameter was specified, a bean with the id/name `com.company.app.DBLoader` was used as a template for wiring the instance created by GemFire. For cases where the bean name uses a different convention, one can pass in the `bean-name` parameter in the GemFire configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<cache-loader>
   <class-name>com.company.app.DBLoader</class-name>
   <!-- pass the bean definition template name
        as parameter -->
   <parameter name="bean-name">
     <string>template-bean</string>
   </parameter>
</cache-loader>
----

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xmlns:p="http://www.springframework.org/schema/p"
       xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
           http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

  <bean id="dataSource" ... />

     <!-- template bean definition -->
     <bean id="template-bean" abstract="true" p:dataSource-ref="dataSource"/>

</beans>
----

NOTE: The *template* bean definitions do not have to be declared in XML - any format is allowed (Groovy, annotations, etc..).

[[apis:declarable:autowiring]]
=== Configuration using auto-wiring and annotations

If no bean definition is found, by default, `WiringDeclarableSupport` will http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#beans-factory-autowire[autowire] the declaring instance. This means that unless any dependency injection *metadata* is offered by the instance, the container will find the object setters and try to automatically satisfy these dependencies. However, one can also use JDK 5 annotations to provide additional information to the auto-wiring process. We strongly recommend reading the dedicated http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#beans-annotation-config[chapter] in the Spring documentation for more information on the supported annotations and enabling factors.

For example, the hypothetical `DBLoader` declaration above can be injected with a Spring-configured `DataSource` in the following way:

[source,java]
----
public class DBLoader extends WiringDeclarableSupport implements CacheLoader {
  // use annotations to 'mark' the needed dependencies
  @javax.inject.Inject
  private DataSource dataSource;

  public Object load(LoaderHelper helper) { ... }
}
----

[source,xml]
----
<cache-loader>
   <class-name>com.company.app.DBLoader</class-name>
   <!-- no need to declare any parameters anymore
        since the class is auto-wired -->
</cache-loader>
----

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xmlns:context="http://www.springframework.org/schema/context"
       xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
           http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
           http://www.springframework.org/schema/context
           http://www.springframework.org/schema/context/spring-context.xsd">

     <!-- enable annotation processing -->
     <context:annotation-config/>

</beans>
----

By using the JSR-330 annotations, the cache loader code has been simplified since the location and creation of the DataSource has been externalized and the user code is concerned only with the loading process. The `DataSource` might be transactional, created lazily, shared between multiple objects or retrieved from JNDI - these aspects can be easily configured and changed through the Spring container without touching the `DBLoader` code.
