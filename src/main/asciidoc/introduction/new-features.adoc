= New Features

NOTE: As of the 1.2.0.RELEASE, this project, formerly known as Spring GemFire, has been renamed to {sdg-name}
to reflect that it is now a module of the {spring-data-website}[Spring Data] project and built on
{x-data-store-website}[{data-store-name}].

[[new-in-1-2-0]]
== New in the 1.2 Release

* Full support for {data-store-name} configuration through the SDG `gfe` XML namespace. Now {data-store-name} components
may be configured completely without requiring a native `cache.xml` file.
* WAN Gateway support for {data-store-name} 6.6.x. See <<bootstrap:gateway>>
* Spring Data Repository support using a dedicated SDG XML namespace, *gfe-data*. See <<gemfire-repositories>>
* `gfe-data` XML Namespace support for registering {data-store-name} Functions. See <<bootstrap:function>>
* A top-level `<disk-store>` element has been added to the SDG `gfe` XML namespace to allow sharing of persist stores
among regions as well as other {data-store-name} components that support persistent backup or overflow.
See <<bootstrap-diskstore>>
+
WARNING: `<*-region>` elements no longer allow a nested `<disk-store>` element.
+
* {data-store-name} Sub-Regions are supported by nested `<*-region>` elements.
* A `<local-region>` element has been added to configure a Local Region.
* Support for the re-designed WAN Gateway in {data-store-name} 7.0.

== New in the 1.3 Release

* Upgraded to Spring Framework 3.2.8.
* Upgraded to Spring Data Commons 1.7.1.
* Annotation support for {data-store-name} Functions. It is now possible to declare and register Functions
written as POJOs by using annotations. In addition, Function executions are defined as
annotated interfaces, similar to the way Spring Data Repositories work. See <<function-annotations>>.
* Added a `<datasource>` element to the SDG XML namespace to simplify establishing a basic <<data-access:datasource,client connection>>
to a {data-store-name} data grid.
* Added a `<json-region-autoproxy>` element to the SDG `gfe-data` XML namespace to <<bootstrap:region:json,support JSON>>
features introduced in {data-store-name} 7.0, enabling Spring AOP to perform the necessary conversions automatically
on Region data access operations.
* Upgraded to {data-store-name} 7.0.1 and added XML namespace support for new `AsyncEventQueue` attributes.
* Added support for setting subscription interest policy on Regions.
* Support for void returns on Function executions.  See <<function-annotations>> for complete details.
* Support for persisting Local Regions. See <<bootstrap:region:local>>.
* Support for entry time-to-live (TTL) and entry idle-time (TTI) on a {data-store-name} Client Cache. See <<bootstrap:cache:client>>
* Support for multiple {sdg-name} web-based applications by using a single {data-store-name} cluster,
operating concurrently inside tc Server.
* Support for `concurrency-checks-enabled` on all Cache Region definitions by using the SDG `gfe` XML namespace.
See <<bootstrap:region:common:attributes>>
* Support for `CacheLoaders` and `CacheWriters` on client, Local Regions.
* Support for registering `CacheListeners`, `AsyncEventQueues`, and `GatewaySenders` on {data-store-name} Cache Sub-Regions.
* Support for PDX persistent keys in Regions.
* Support for correct Partition Region bean creation in a Spring context when collocation is specified with
the `colocated-with` attribute.
* Full support for Cache Sub-Regions using proper, nested `<*-region>` element syntax in the SDG `gfe` XML namespace.

and a Spring Boot sample application that demonstrates {data-store-name} Cache Transactions configured with SDG
and bootstrapped with Spring Boot.

See <<gemfire-bootstrap>>
* Added support for persisting application domain object and entities to multiple {data-store-name} Cache Regions.
See <<mapping.entities>>
* Added support for persisting application domain object and entities to {data-store-name} Cache Sub-Regions,
avoiding collisions when Sub-Regions are uniquely identifiable, but identically named.
See <<mapping.entities>>
* Added strict XSD type rules to Data Policies and Region Shortcuts on all {data-store-name} Cache Region types.
* Changed the default behavior of SDG `<*-region>` elements from lookup to always create a new Region
with an option to restore the old behavior using the `ignore-if-exists` attribute.
See <<bootstrap:region:common:attributes, Common Region Attributes>>
and <<bootstrap:region:common:regions-subregions-lookups-caution>>
