= Configuring a DiskStore

Spring Data for Pivotal GemFire supports `DiskStore` configuration and creation through the `disk-store` element, as the following example shows:

[source,xml]
----
<gfe:disk-store id="Example" auto-compact="true" max-oplog-size="10"
        queue-size="50" time-interval="9999">
    <gfe:disk-dir location="/disk/location/one" max-size="20"/>
    <gfe:disk-dir location="/disk/location/two" max-size="20"/>
</gfe:disk-store>
----

`DiskStore` instances are used by regions for file system persistent backup and overflow of evicted entries
as well as persistent backup for WAN Gateways. Multiple Pivotal GemFire components may share the same `DiskStore`.
Additionally, multiple file system directories may be defined for a single `DiskStore`, as shown in the preceding example.

See Pivotal GemFire's documentation for a complete explanation of
http://gemfire.docs.pivotal.io/95/geode/developing/storing_data_on_disk/chapter_overview.html[Persistence and Overflow]
and configuration options on `DiskStore` instances.
