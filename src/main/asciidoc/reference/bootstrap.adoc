= Bootstrapping GemFire with the Spring container

Spring Data GemFire provides full configuration and initialization of the Pivotal GemFire In-Memory Data Grid
using the Spring IoC container.  The framework includes several classes to help simplify the configuration of
Pivotal GemFire components including: Caches, Regions, Indexes, DiskStores, Functions, WAN Gateways, persistence backup
along with several other Distributed System components in order to support a variety of use cases with minimal effort.

NOTE: This section assumes basic familiarity with Pivotal GemFire. For more information,
see the http://www.pivotal.io/big-data/pivotal-gemfire[product documentation].

== Advantages of using Spring over GemFire `cache.xml`

As of release 1.2.0, Spring Data GemFire's XML namespace supports full configuration of the GemFire In-Memory Data Grid.
In fact, Spring Data GemFire's XML namespace is considered to be the preferred way to configure GemFire.
GemFire will continue to support native `cache.xml` for legacy reasons, but GemFire application developers can now do
everything in Spring XML and take advantage of the many wonderful things Spring has to offer such as
modular XML configuration, property placeholders and overrides, SpEL, and environment profiles. Behind the
XML namespace, Spring Data GemFire makes extensive use of Spring's `FactoryBean` pattern to simplify the creation,
configuration and initialization of GemFire components.

For example, GemFire provides several callback interfaces, such as `CacheListener`, `CacheWriter`, and `CacheLoader`,
that allow developers to add custom event handlers. Using Spring's IoC container, these callbacks may be configured
as normal Spring beans and injected into GemFire components. This is a significant improvement over native `cache.xml`,
which provides relatively limited configuration options and requires callbacks to implement GemFire's `Declarable` interface
(see <<apis:declarable>> to see how you can still use `Declarables` within Spring's IoC/DI container).

In addition, IDEs such as the Spring Tool Suite (STS) provide excellent support for Spring XML namespaces, such as
code completion, pop-up annotations, and real time validation, making them easy to use.

== Using the Core Spring Data GemFire Namespace

To simplify configuration, Spring Data GemFire provides a dedicated XML namespace for configuring core GemFire components.
It is also possible to configure beans directly using Spring's standard <bean> definition. However, as of
Spring Data GemFire 1.2.0, all bean properties are exposed via the XML namespace so there is little benefit to using
raw bean definitions. For more information about XML Schema-based configuration in Spring, see
http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#xsd-config[this] appendix
in the Spring Framework reference documentation.

NOTE: Spring Data Repository support uses a separate XML namespace. See <<gemfire-repositories>> for more information
on how to configure Spring Data GemFire Repositories.

To use the Spring Data GemFire XML namespace, simply declare it in your Spring XML configuration meta-data:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
  xmlns:gfe="http://www.springframework.org/schema/gemfire"<!--1--><!--2-->
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:schemaLocation="
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/gemfire http://www.springframework.org/schema/gemfire/spring-gemfire.xsd"> <!--3-->

  <bean id ... >

  <gfe:cache ...> <!--4-->

</beans>
----
<1> Spring GemFire namespace prefix. Any name will do but through out the reference documentation, `gfe` will be used.
<2> The namespace URI.
<3> The namespace URI location. Note that even though the location points to an external address (which exists and is valid), Spring will resolve the schema locally as it is included in the Spring Data GemFire library.
<4> Declaration example for the GemFire namespace. Notice the prefix usage.

[NOTE]
====
It is possible to change the default namespace, for example from `beans` to `gfe`. This is useful for configuration
composed mainly of GemFire components as it avoids declaring the prefix. To achieve this, simply swap the namespace
prefix declaration above:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/gemfire" <!--1-->
  xmlns:beans="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"<!--2-->
  xsi:schemaLocation="
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/gemfire http://www.springframework.org/schema/gemfire/spring-gemfire.xsd">

  <beans:bean id ... > <!--3-->

  <cache ...> <!--4-->

</beans>
----
<1> The default namespace declaration for this XML file points to the Spring Data GemFire namespace.
<2> The `beans` namespace prefix declaration.
<3> Bean declaration using the `beans` namespace. Notice the prefix.
<4> Bean declaration using the `gfe` namespace. Notice the lack of prefix (as the default namespace is used).
