== Creating an Index

Pivotal GemFire allows Indexes (or Indices) to be created to improve the performance of OQL queries.

In _Spring Data GemFire_, Indices can be declared with the `index` element:

[source,xml]
----
<gfe:index id="myIndex" expression="someField" from="/someRegion"/>
----

Before creating an `Index`, Spring Data GemFire will verify whether an `Index` with the same name already exists.
If an `Index` with the same name does exist, by default, SDG will "override" the existing `Index`
by removing the old `Index` first followed by creating a new `Index` with the same name using the new bean definition,
regardless if the old `Index` definition was the same or not.

To prevent the named `Index` definition change, especially when the old and new `Index` definitions differ
in a significant way, then set the `override` attribute to `false`, which effectively returns the existing
`Index` definition given the same name.

`Index` declarations are not bound to a Region but rather are top-level elements (just like `cache`).
This allows one to declare any number of Indices on any Region whether they are just created or already exist
- an improvement over GemFire's native `cache.xml`. By default, the `Index` relies on the default cache declaration
but one can customize it accordingly or use a Pool (if need be) - see the XML schema for a full set of options.
