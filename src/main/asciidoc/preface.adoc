= Preface

Spring Data for Pivotal GemFire focuses on integrating the Spring Framework's powerful, non-invasive programming model
and concepts with Pivotal GemFire to simplify configuration and development of Java applications when you use Pivotal GemFire.

This document assumes you already have a basic understanding of and some familiarity with the core Spring Framework
and Pivotal GemFire concepts and APIs.

While every effort has been made to ensure this documentation is comprehensive and complete without errors,
some topics are beyond the scope of this document and may require more explanation (for example, data distribution management
using partitioning with HA while still preserving consistency).  Additionally, some typographical errors might have crept in.
If you do spot mistakes or even more serious errors, please bring these issues
to the attention of the Spring Data team by raising an appropriate
https://jira.spring.io/browse/SGF[issue in JIRA].
